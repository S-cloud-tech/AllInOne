                    A few quick email excerpt: Last night I have concerned by those posts with no personal information being removed, and of the posts asking for personal information from me. To keep it short, I have no desire to share any of that information with anyone. I have no personal social media that I am willing to give away. That is not because I have something to hide, but because I prefer to keep these things with select personal friends. I have no facebook, twitter, Instagram, linked in, or myspace, I have no desire to create these accounts, all I ask is that instead of being harassed over this matter I be left alone.
